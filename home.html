            <h2>Introduction/History:</h2>
            <p> Espada was founded in 1981 when our CEO Lorenzo Martinez realized the need for reputable private security services in his home state of Arizona, as a martial arts expert he was well acquainted with Bushido which is the samurai code of honor and used it as the foundation for training Espada bodyguards who work hard and never quit. The idea for the company came to Martinez while he was training in Kendo, the Japanese martial art of sword fighting, so he named the company Espada.</p>
